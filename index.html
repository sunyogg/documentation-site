          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming
            language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data
            structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make
            it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for
            use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components
            together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes
            readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance.
            Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program
            modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive
            standard library are available in source or binary form without
            charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.
            Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased
            productivity it provides. Since there is no compilation step, the
            edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs
            is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault.
            Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an
            exception. When the program doesn't catch the exception, the
            interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level debugger allows
            inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary
            expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a line
            at a time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python itself,
            testifying to Python's introspective power. On the other hand, often
            the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements
            to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple
            approach very effective.

          <h3>Variables</h3>
          <p>
            Variables are containers for storing data values. Python has no
            command for declaring a variable. A variable is created the moment
            you first assign a value to it. A Python variable is a name given to
            a memory location. It is the basic unit of storage in a program. The
            value stored in a variable can be changed during program execution.
            <br />Varibles of type int:
            <code class="codes">x = 5</code>
            Variable of type str:
            <code class="codes">y = "John"</code>
            Varible of type float:
            <code class="codes">z = 12.345</code>
            Variables of type boolean:
            <code class="codes">a = true</code>
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="third-content" class="third-content content-para">
          <h3>Lists</h3>
          <p>
            Python knows a number of compound data types, used to group together
            other values. The most versatile is the list, which can be written
            as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets.
            Lists might contain items of different types, but usually the items
            all have the same type. Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in
            Python used to store collections of data.<br />
            Defining a List:
            <code class="codes">a = [1, 2, 3]</code>
            A list can contain elements of multiple data types:
            <code class="codes"
              >b = [4, 5, 6, "apple", "mango", 4.5, true]</code
            >
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="fourth-content" class="fourth-content content-para">
          <h3>Dictionaries</h3>
          <p>
            Another useful data type built into Python is the dictionary.
            Dictionaries are sometimes found in other languages as “associative
            memories” or “associative arrays”. Unlike sequences, which are
            indexed by a range of numbers, dictionaries are indexed by keys,
            which can be any immutable type; strings and numbers can always be
            keys. Tuples can be used as keys if they contain only strings,
            numbers, or tuples; if a tuple contains any mutable object either
            directly or indirectly, it cannot be used as a key. You can’t use
            lists as keys, since lists can be modified in place using index
            assignments, slice assignments, or methods like append() and
            extend().
          </p>
          <p>
            It is best to think of a dictionary as a set of key: value pairs,
            with the requirement that the keys are unique (within one
            dictionary). A pair of braces creates an empty dictionary: {}.
            Placing a comma-separated list of key:value pairs within the braces
            adds initial key:value pairs to the dictionary; this is also the way
            dictionaries are written on output.<br />
            Defining a Dictionary:
            <code class="codes"
              >d = {"name":"John", "age":23, "sex":"male",
              "location":"california"}</code
            >
          </p>

        <section id="fifth-content" class="fifth-content content-para">
          <h3>Sets</h3>
          <p>
            Python also includes a data type for sets. A set is an unordered
            collection with no duplicate elements. Basic uses include membership
            testing and eliminating duplicate entries. Set objects also support
            mathematical operations like union, intersection, difference, and
            symmetric difference. Curly braces or the set() function can be used
            to create sets. Note: to create an empty set you have to use set(),
            not {}; the latter creates an empty dictionary, a data structure
            that we discuss in the next section.<br />
            Defining a set:
            <code class="codes">s = ("apple", "mango", "banana", 28)</code>

          <h3>The print() function</h3>
          <p>
            The print() function prints the specified message to the screen, or
            other standard output device. The message can be a string, or any
            other object, the object will be converted into a string before
            written to the screen. Though it is not necessary to pass arguments
            in the print() function, it requires an empty parenthesis at the end
            that tells python to execute the function rather calling it by name.
            Now, let’s explore the optional arguments that can be used with the
            print() function.
            <code class="codes"
              >print("Hello World!") <br />
              <span class="indent-2"> print(28)</span>
            </code>
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="seventh-content" class="seventh-content content-para">
          <h3>if..elif..else statement</h3>
          <p>
            if…elif…else are conditional statements that provide you with the
            decision making that is required when you want to execute code based
            on a particular condition. The if…elif…else statement used in Python
            helps automate that decision making process.
          </p>
          <p>
            The if condition is considered the simplest of the three and makes a
            decision based on whether the condition is true or not. If the
            condition is true, it prints out the indented expression. If the
            condition is false, it skips printing the indented expression.
            <code class="codes"
              >if condition:<br />
              <span class="indent-2">expression</span></code
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            The if-else condition adds an additional step in the decision-making
            process compared to the simple if statement. The beginning of an
            if-else statement operates similar to a simple if statement;
            however, if the condition is false, instead of printing nothing, the
            indented expression under else will be printed.
            <codes class="codes"
              >if condition: <br />
              <span class="indent-2">expression<br /></span>
              else:<br />
              <span class="indent-2">expression</span></codes

          <h3>The for loop</h3>
          <p>
            The for statement in Python differs a bit from what you may be used
            to in C or Pascal. Rather than always iterating over an arithmetic
            progression of numbers (like in Pascal), or giving the user the
            ability to define both the iteration step and halting condition (as
            C), Python’s for statement iterates over the items of any sequence
            (a list or a string), in the order that they appear in the sequence.
            <code class="codes"
              >words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']<br />
              for i in words :<br />
              <span class="indent-2">print(i)</span>

          <h3>The while loop</h3>
          <p>
            The while statement is used for repeated execution as long as an
            expression is true. The while loop requires relevant variables to be
            ready, in this example we need to define an indexing variable, i,
            which we set to 1. With the break statement we can stop the loop
            even if the while condition is true:
            <code class="codes">
              i = 1 <br />
              while i &lt; 6: <br />
              <span class="indent-2">print(i)<br /></span>
              <span class="indent-2"> if i == 3: <br /></span>
              <span class="indent-4">break <br /></span>
              <span class="indent-2">i += 1 <br /></span>
            </code>

          <h3>Functions</h3>
          <p>
            A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You
            can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. A function can
            return data as a result.
            <code class="codes"
              >def my_function(): <br />
              <span class="indent-2">print("Hello from a function")</span></code
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            To call a function, use the function name followed by parenthesis:
            <code class="codes"
              >def my_function():<br />
              <span class="indent-2">print("Hello from a function")<br /></span>
              my_function()</code
